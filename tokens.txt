Cunningham added that in the case of connected vehicles the mass adoption of vehicle-to-everything technologies has the potential to significantly improve the overall safety of increasingly chaotic and dangerous streets allowing for advanced levels of connectivity data sharing and improved coordination between cars and infrastructure bicycles pedestrians and scooters A secure enabled network could have the processing capability and download speeds to warn vehicles of hazardous traffic issues even predict dangerous situations far ahead of the driver s line of sight said Cunningham a former Central Intelligence Agency officer and White House National Security Council attorney It could provide information to drivers whether human or autonomous to avoid crashes and even steer clear of those situations and intersections that are most likely to cause them. But Cunningham suggested that today s networks are not able to provide customers with continuous and real-time indicators of the security of these public networks even for higher-security connections called secure slices. This makes it impossible for users to follow current best practices of Zero Trust security which require continuous authentication so that trust is earned rather than assumed he said Whilst properly implemented end-to-end encryption can protect the confidentiality and integrity of transiting data it can not prevent compromises along the network itself. Such attacks can exfiltrate location and other metadata harvest communication for future quantum-enabled or other offline decryption and degrade or even eliminate the ability to communicate according to Cunningham Collaborators in this newly funded multi-stakeholder project between UCI and BlackBerry will formulate techniques for assessing the trustworthiness of software running within network infrastructures and will develop technical foundations and legal and regulatory frameworks for Cooperative Zero Trust a novel ZT framework to enable cooperation across traditional ZT boundaries for networks UCI is thrilled to partner with BlackBerry in this exciting project that will reach across disciplines including computer science engineering law and regulation Cunningham said Solving this complex set of problems is important to our national and economic security and will save lives It is precisely the type of challenge for which CPRI was created bringing together multiple disciplines in academia business and government to solve hard but vitally important challenges We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for supporting this work. Cooperating on cybersecurity really is a grand challenge noted Charles Eagan BlackBerry s chief technology officer It s not just a technical problem If operators and their clients are going to work together to share cybersecurity intelligence in real-time we will have to also solve policy and regulatory challenges and build a trustworthy foundation for our cooperation I m very excited to partner with UCI and CPRI in this innovative program to help address this grand challenge.
